# Two United States police officers walk on the sidewalk in a city of traffic and sidewalk.
# The policeman on the left has a dark complexion, a result of his height and rounded posture.
# He moves in an alternative, almost careless manner, waving his arms out of necessity and chewing gum.
# His facial expression is one of boredom or specificity.
#
# The policeman on the right is fair-skinned, redundant, slim and looks nervous.
# While walking, gesturing with his right hand, the words: "What would you do?"
# After a moment, come into existence and turn towards your partner, causing the effects that may occur.
#
# Behind them, in the background, a white SUV slowly drives by.
# Around city traffic - on the sidewalk visible to other passers-by.
# On the left side of the frame there is a man sitting on the ground,
# supported by women and may not be visible. is maintained in an urban environment,
# with the possibility of affecting people and vehicles in the background.
# The people in the background are normal people, not police officers.
# There are maybe 4 of them. The area looks like a Brooklyn suburb, there are no tall buildings.
# You can see clothes hanging on a line. There are only two policemen in the video.
